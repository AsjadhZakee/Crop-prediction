# Crop-prediction
A machine learning-powered crop recommendation system that predicts the best crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil conditions provided by the user.

This project uses a classification approach to suggest crops based on:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

We trained multiple models and selected the best one based on accuracy for crop prediction.
